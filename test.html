        <pre> <p id="bad">In US law, a pretext usually describes false reasons that hide the true intentions or motivations for a legal action. If a party can estab
            lish a prima facie case for the proffered evidence, the opposing party must prove that these
            reasons were "pretextual" or false. This can be accomplished by directly demonstrating that the motivations behind the presentation of evidence is false, or indirectly by evidence 
            that the motivations are not "credible".[1] In Griffith v. Schnitzer,
            an employment discrimination case, a jury award was reversed by a Court of Appeals because the evidence was not sufficient that the defen
            dant's reasons were "pretextual". That is, the defendant's evidence was either undisputed, or the plaintiff's
            was "irrelevant subjective assessments and opinions".[2] A "pretextual" arrest by law enforcement officers is one carried out for illegal p</p>
        
        
        <p>  rposes such as to conduct an unjustified search and seizure.[3][4] Marble Boat on Kunming Lake near Beijing
            As one example of pretext, in the 1880s, the Chinese government raised money on the pretext of modernizing the Chinese navy. Instead, these funds wer
            e diverted to repair a ship-shaped, two-story pavilion which had been originally constructed for
            the mother of the Qianlong Emperor. This pretext and the Marble Barge are famously linked with Empress Dowager Cixi. This architectural
             folly, known today as the Marble Boat (Shifang), is "moored" on Lake Kunming in what the empress renamed the
            "Garden for Cultivating Harmony" (Yiheyuan).[5]</p>
